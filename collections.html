		<strong>Highly Recommended Resources</strong><br/>
		    <ul>
                <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/surv-149/12">
                  Translation between mathematicians' and physicists' dialect</a>, Chapter One in G. Folland's book, a good resource provided to math people to understand 
			    physicists' commonly used notation on Hilbert space, tensors, Fourier transforms and Lie group. It is written in a very neat way (which is rare). </li>        	
                </ul>
		
		<strong>Some Interesting Quotes</strong><br/>
		    <ul>
                  Eugene Wigner once said in an <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wigner.pdf"> article</a>: "The miracle of the appropriateness of the language of mathematics to the formulation of the laws of physics 
			is a wonderful gift which we neither understand nor deserve." </li>        	
                </ul>
		
		<strong>Mathematicians and Scientists</strong><br/>
		    <ul>
			      <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198570646.001.0001/acprof-9780198570646">
                  Ludwig Boltzmann: The Man Who Trusted Atoms</a>, a great book to understand Ludwig Boltzmann, and the physics between classical and modern.</li>
        
                   <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374536671">
                  Birth of a theorem</a>, by French mathematician and Fields medalist CÃ©dric Villani. It's always nice to admire the journey of arguably one of the greatest mathematicians of our time, and start to dwell into the fantasy that one day, maybe we can have a similar tale to tell.</li>
        
		 
               <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/PT.3.2984">
                  Planck: Driven by Vision, Broken by War</a>, a great book to understand Planck's intellectual and personal life. It's vital to understand the history of modern physics under the background of world wars.  </li>	
				    
			    
		
		</ul>
		    
		<strong>Math & Science related</strong><br/>
                
                <ul>
                <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48749235-story-of-your-life">
                  Stories of your life</a>, a beautiful fiction by Ted Chiang, which involves the beauty of Fermat principle, and more generally the least action principle. It's 
        indeed breathtaking that almost every field of physics have a least-action-principle interpretation.</li>
		 <li class="pap" words="addre"><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/154060.A_Mathematician_s_Apology">
                  A mathematician's apology</a>, by great British mathematician G. H. Hardy. A great book to take a look at the taste of pure mathematicians. (I mean, really really pure mathematicians.) 
			The comments about mathematical physics and applied mathematics are harsh, but somewhat true.   </li>
